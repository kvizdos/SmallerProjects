# Smaller Projects
This is a repo full of most of my smaller, mostly static, sites that I've made for school projects and fun.

All projects are filed under different folders, and each project contains a screenshot folder that is filled with a full-length screenshot (everything), mobile full-length, and a header photo.

## How to view the pages
You can view any of these smaller projects at "https://site-projects.home.kentonvizdos.com/<folder>". 

Example:
  
https://site-projects.home.kentonvizdos.com/The%20Haunt/ (it works with spaces, too, so /The Haunt/ works as well)
