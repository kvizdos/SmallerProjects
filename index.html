<h1>Smaller Projects</h1>
<p>This subdomain contains all of my smaller projects that either didn't make the final cut to being an official site, or are sites that I made for school / practice / conceptual work.</p>

<p>You can view any page listed on <a href="https://github.com/kvizdos/SmallerProjects/" target="_blank">my SmallerProjects GitHub repo</a> by simply adding /<folder> to this domain.</p> 

<p>Example:</p>
<a href="https://site-projects.home.kentonvizdos.com/The%20Haunt/">https://site-projects.home.kentonvizdos.com/The Haunt/</a>
